# Node Wrangler

React library for node-based thingies, I'm not too sure what this is going to be, might be a developer too, might be a user interface, who knows, not me thats for sure.


TODO:
 - Handle input change and output updates by events, e.g. when multiply product drag onto content console log, make content console log listen to product some how, maybe by ID or something. Then mulitply will emit the event with its id.
